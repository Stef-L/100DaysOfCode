Progress of #100DaysOfCode Challenge

0/100: 
  Registered at github; Updated AndroidStudio to newest version
  
1/100: 
  BugFixing in CVAGAuskunft - after update of AndroidStudio to 3.6 dependencies (Jetpack AndroidX.SwipeRefreshLayout) had to be set + new JVMTarget needed to be assigned (found out after googling but don't understand the reason)

2/100:
	Created a Settings-Activity and read Key-Value-Data from another Activity
	Found out about the difference between getPreferences (works only in 1 activity) and getSharedPreferences (works within 1 app)

3/100:
	Tried to use a ConstraintLayout with LayoutParams to set the Layout for different TextViews.
	It didn't work out. :(
	Need to search some more for example usages and find out where's the difference from the Buttons in the MainActivity.

4/100:
	Created a launcher icon for the app. Cool thing to actually see it on the phone! :)
	Did some error searching and restored a previous state although this is also still not working properly in the SettingsActivity. Will have to search for it. Or maybe try and find out how to create a list of movable items and then how to store the order.
	Created a new signed APK for install on the physical phone.
